 * For advance escaping make use of a 3rd party library like
 * [he](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he) and create
 * your own sanitization rule
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { sanitizations } from 'indicative/sanitizer'
 *
 * const sanitizationRules = {
 *   message: 'escape'
 * }
 *
 * // or
 * const sanitizationRules = {
 *   message: [
 *     sanitizations.escape()
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
