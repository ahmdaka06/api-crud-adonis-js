## Features

1. Support for url-encoded and multipart form bodies.
2. Accepts [JSON Patch [RFC6902]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)
3. Accepts [JSON API v1](http://jsonapi.org/)
4. Accepts [JSON csp-report](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/csp-reports)
5. Accepts raw text and buffers.
6. Seamless support for nested arrays within the form body.
7. Stream files directly to **s3** using [node-flydrive](https://github.com/Slynova-Org/node-flydrive)
8. Conditionally consume uploaded files as streams.
9. Set hard limits on server to deny request payload greater than `x` bytes.


## Usage
The body parser is pre-configured with every new AdonisJs application. But in case you want to setup it manually.

### Installation
```bash
npm i --save adonis-bodyparser
```

### Setup
Make sure to register the provider inside `start/app.js` file.

```js
const providers = [
  ...
  'adonis-bodyparsers/providers/BodyParser'
]
```

Once the provider has been setup, it will automatically register a global middleware for you.

## Node/OS Target

This repo/branch is supposed to run fine on all major OS platforms and targets `Node.js >=7.0`

## Development

Great! If you are planning to contribute to the framework, make sure to adhere to following conventions, since a consistent code-base is always joy to work with.

Run the following command to see list of available npm scripts.

```
npm run
```

### Tests & Linting

1. Lint your code using standardJs. Run `npm run lint` command to check if there are any linting errors.
2. Make sure you write tests for all the changes/bug fixes.
3. Also you can write **regression tests**, which shows that something is failing but doesn't breaks the build. Which is actually a nice way to show that something fails. Regression tests are written using `test.failing()` method.
4. Make sure all the tests are passing on `travis` and `appveyor`.

### General Practices

Since Es6 is in, you should strive to use latest features. For example:

1. Use `Spread` over `arguments` keyword.
2. Never use `bind` or `call`. After calling these methods, we cannot guarantee the scope of any methods and in AdonisJs codebase we do not override the methods scope.
3. Make sure to write proper docblock.

## Issues & PR

It is always helpful if we try to follow certain practices when creating issues or PR's, since it will save everyone's time.

1. Always try creating regression tests when you find a bug (if possible).
2. Share some context on what you are trying to do, with enough code to reproduce the issue.
3. For general questions, please create a forum thread.
4. When creating a PR for a feature, make sure to create a parallel PR for docs too.


## Regression Tests

Regression tests are tests, which shows how a piece of code fails under certain circumstance, but the beauty is even after the failure, the test suite will never fail. Actually is a nice way to notify about bugs, but making sure everything is green.

The regression tests are created using

```
test.failing('2 + 2 is always 4, but add method returns 6', (assert) => {
 assert.true(add(2, 2), 4)
})
```

Now since the `add` method has a bug, it will return `6` instead of `4`. But the build will pass.
